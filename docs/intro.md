I'll create a comprehensive educational operating system simulator in Python that you can teach over 10 weeks. This will cover fundamental OS concepts with clean, well-documented code.I've created a comprehensive educational OS simulator that covers 10 weeks of material. Here's the teaching structure:

## **10-Week Course Outline:**

### **Week 1-2: Process Management**
- Process states (NEW, READY, RUNNING, WAITING, TERMINATED)
- Process Control Block (PCB) representation
- Process lifecycle and state transitions

### **Week 3: CPU Scheduling**
- First-Come-First-Served (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Round Robin with time quantum
- Performance metrics (waiting time, turnaround time)

### **Week 4-5: Memory Management**
- Contiguous memory allocation
- First-fit allocation algorithm
- Fragmentation and coalescing
- Memory deallocation

### **Week 6: Paging**
- Logical vs physical addresses
- Page tables and address translation
- Page faults
- Frame allocation

### **Week 7: Synchronization**
- Semaphores (wait/signal operations)
- Critical sections
- Process synchronization
- Producer-consumer problem concepts

### **Week 8: Deadlock**
- Deadlock detection
- Banker's algorithm
- Resource allocation graphs
- Safe vs unsafe states

### **Week 9: File Systems**
- I-nodes and file metadata
- Directory structures
- File operations (create, read, list)
- File system organization

### **Week 10: I/O & Disk Scheduling**
- FCFS disk scheduling
- SCAN (elevator) algorithm
- Seek time calculation
- I/O request handling

## **For Remaining Weeks, You Can Discuss:**
- Virtual memory and demand paging
- Thrashing and working sets
- Different page replacement algorithms (LRU, FIFO, Optimal)
- Threads vs processes
- Inter-process communication (pipes, message queues)
- Security and protection mechanisms
- Real-world OS comparisons (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- Modern OS concepts (containers, virtualization)

The code is modular, well-documented, and each week's concept can be run independently for demonstrations!
